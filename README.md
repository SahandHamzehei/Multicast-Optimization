# Multicast Optimization: Operational Research Theory and Applications

## Introduction
Multicasting routing sits at the crux of ensuring data transmission from one or multiple sources to numerous destinations. The overarching ambition is to maximize the utilization of available resources while executing this transmission, encapsulating aspects such as bandwidth, time, and connection expenses. This research endeavors to optimize the complex realm of multicast routing, diving deep into prevalent challenges and solutions, paired with their mathematical underpinnings. A Python-based emulation to address these challenges is also examined.
